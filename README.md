# pilar-snippets README

## Description
Pillar Snippets is designed to enhance your coding productivity by generating code directly based on the chosen prefix. This extension significantly saves time by providing instant code snippets for HTML, TypeScript (TS), and CSS.

## Features
- **Generate HTML**: The Generate HTML feature allows you to quickly produce well-structured HTML code snippets by selecting the appropriate prefix. This is especially useful for web developers who need to create standard HTML elements and structures efficiently, ensuring consistency and reducing the time spent on repetitive coding tasks.

- **Generate TypeScript**: The Generate TypeScript feature enables you to instantly create TypeScript code snippets based on predefined prefixes. This helps in maintaining a consistent coding style and speeds up the development process, particularly when working with complex TypeScript components and modules. It is ideal for developers who want to ensure type safety and leverage TypeScriptâ€™s powerful features without writing boilerplate code from scratch.

- **Generate CSS**: The Generate CSS feature allows you to quickly generate CSS code snippets according to the selected prefix. This feature is beneficial for front-end developers who need to apply styling to web pages efficiently. By using predefined prefixes, you can ensure that your CSS is consistent and follows best practices, making your design process faster and more reliable.
